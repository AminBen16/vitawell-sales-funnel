Foreward by the CEO
I began my journey in network marketing back in 2009. At the time, I was fresh out of secondary school, in
my Senior 6 vacation, just before joining university. I was completely green—no experience in marketing,
no sales skills, no idea how to talk to clients or train people. I didn’t know a single thing about business. I
was simply a young man, full of excitement and driven by a dream.
Since then, my journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster—filled with highs and lows, victories and
setbacks. But what matters most is that, through persistence and learning, I eventually succeeded as a
network marketing distributor. This success paved the way for me to co-found OQATA Wellness Solutions.
For me, network marketing is more than a business—it’s a mission. I’ve seen firsthand how it gives anyone,
regardless of their background, a real chance at living the life of their dreams. Whether you lack experience,
capital, or formal education, network marketing provides a platform where you can be taught, trained, and
mentored into success. That’s the true power of this industry—and it’s what keeps me passionate and
committed to it every single day.
I’ve witnessed countless individuals join this business broken—emotionally, financially, and mentally—yet
rise to success through learning, guidance, and belief. I am a firm believer in the fact that every person has
potential, and I know that what was done for me can be done for you too.
This booklet, “Get Started Right and Strong,” is designed as your first step in the journey. Whether you’re
brand new or already have some experience in network marketing or sales, this guide will help you lay a
solid foundation. By learning the right strategies, applying them consistently, and believing in yourself, you
can absolutely succeed.
Please take this orientation seriously. It was created with great intention and care to set you up for long-term
success. I believe in your potential. The entire OQATA Wellness Solutions family believes in your potential.
And with the right mindset and training, you will go far.
Welcome to Oqata Wellness Solutions.
God bless you, and enjoy every page of this journey.

CEO, OQATA Wellness Solutions

What We Are and What We Are Not
At OQATA Wellness Solutions, we are not:
• A "get-rich-quick" scheme where success comes without effort.
• An investment firm where passive income is guaranteed without work.
• A share-selling business offering dividends.
• A job recruitment firm providing fixed salaries.
Instead, we offer a lucrative commission-based business opportunity to those interested in becoming
independent distributors of our products. The commission is earned based on your hard work and dedication
in promoting our world-class products directly or through your team, as our compensation plan provides. All
IBOs are strictly expected to present our products and business opportunity with honesty and integrity in
accordance to our policies and procedures which every IBO agrees to during our online onboarding process.
A downloadable version of these policies and procedures is available for your review on your dashboard and
on our website.
Your Application Fee
Your journey begins with one of our four entry-level business kits. Each business kit varies in price and
benefits, such as pairing bonus caps, product samples, and opportunities for rank advancement. The
premium business kit offers the highest benefits and that’s why we give you the opportunity to upgrade to a
premium business kit even when you started at lower entry levels.
Your application fee covers a comprehensive Business Kit, which includes:
• Product Samples: For you to experience
the quality of our naturally inspired,
scientifically proven products.
• Price List: A detailed product catalog with
prices and the Commission Values (CVs)
we use to calculate your commissions.
• Business Presentation Guide: A tool to
help you understand and promote our
products and our business model to those
interested in becoming independent
distributors (IBOs) of our products
• The Get Started Right and Strong
(GSRS) Booklet: A step-by-step guide to
launch your business effectively.
• IBO Application Forms: Forms that new
applicants interested in becoming IBOs fill
out as part of their application process.
• IBO Dashboard Access: A centralized hub
to manage your business, access trainings,
and view, track, and withdraw your
commissions.
• Lifetime Discount: Special rates on all
OQATA products, available exclusively to
IBOs.
• Access to Training Facilities: Use of
company training halls for meetings and
presentations.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Your Role as an IBO
As an IBO, your responsibilities include:
• Promoting our products and their benefits
to potential customers.
• Sharing the business opportunity with
prospective members who wish to be
independent distributors of our products,
just like you. (This must be done truthfully
as per our policies and procedures without
misrepresenting the company compensation
plan)
• Supporting, training, motivating, and
mentoring your team members to succeed.
• Continuously learning about our products,
our business model, and the industry as a
whole.
• Participating in company events and
training sessions.
• Complying with company policies and
procedures and presenting our business
opportunity and products with honesty and
integrity and only as provided by our
compensation plan
• Complying with local state and tax laws.
Please note that OQATA does not file taxes
on your behalf. We only withhold and remit
the required withholding tax to the relevant
tax authority. You can claim this amount
when filing your income tax in accordance
with your state’s regulations.

The role of Your Upline:
Your upline serves as your mentor, guiding and
supporting you in setting and achieving your
business goals. However, success depends on your
own effort and determination. They are not
obligated to do the business for you. They are not
your boss or your employer. They are expected to
treat you with respect and as an independent
business owner just like them.
The role of the Company:
OQATA Wellness Solutions is dedicated to
empowering you. We provide:
• High-quality products you can share confidently.
• Comprehensive training programs and
resources to help you succeed.
• A rewarding compensation plan to celebrate
your achievements.
• We pay you commissions earned per our
compensation plan and local tax laws.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
OQATA’s Tools of Trade
Your first assignment as a new IBO is simple—but powerful: get your Tools of Trade. These are the
essential tools you'll use to build your business every single day. Take this seriously—success begins with
being prepared.
Here’s what you need:
1. Name List – A small booklet where you write down all your contacts. This is the foundation of your
network.
2. Notebook – Preferably hardcover, this is for taking notes during trainings, mentorship, and personal
learning.
3. Presentation Guide – A booklet provided to every new IBO that includes details about OQATA
products and the compensation plan.
4. Book of Circles – A spiral notebook used during presentations for rough work, diagrams, and extra
explanations of the business or products.
5. Goal Card – A dedicated card where you write your business goals and targets. Keep it interactive—
it serves as a daily reminder to stay focused and intentional.
Make sure you get these Tools of Trade immediately—they're not just materials, they’re your daily
business partners. Treat this assignment with the seriousness it deserves, and you’ll be off to a powerful start.
______________________________________________________________________________________
OQATA’s Daily Method of Operation (DMO)
Success at OQATA isn’t a matter of chance—it’s the result of consistency, discipline, and intentional daily
action. We've created a simple yet powerful DMO that, when practiced every day, leads to real, lasting
success.
The key is daily commitment. Your future is shaped by what you choose to do today, and every day.
Our DMO is straightforward and effective:
• Use the products
• Recommend the products
• Share the opportunity
• Expand your Name list
• Learn and Teach
Stay consistent. Stay committed. Success will follow.
3
Understanding and Putting Your DMO into Action
Step 1: USE the Products
To succeed with OQATA, you must first become a
product of the product. Commit to using OQATA
products every day. Even if you begin with just one
item, make it a non-negotiable part of your daily
routine.
When you consistently use the products, you don’t
just enjoy the benefits—you develop real belief,
confidence, and a personal story. That kind of
authenticity is powerful. It makes sharing with
others natural, because you're speaking from
experience—not theory.
! Action Step:
Before you continue reading, pause for a moment.
Pick one product from your business kit, open it,
and use it right now.
This is your first step toward success—if you’re
truly committed.
Make a promise to yourself: “I will never go a day
without using at least one OQATA product.”
And if you can use more than one? Even better!
Step 2: RECOMMEND the Products
Every single day is a fresh opportunity to introduce
someone to the incredible benefits of OQATA
products. Whether it's through a personal
conversation, a text, or a quick social media post—
make it a daily habit to recommend.
Let someone discover OQATA because you told
them. Your voice could be the reason someone
starts their wellness journey.
! Action Step:
You're new—but at OQATA, we move with
purpose. We want you to start earning from day
one and get a return on your investment as quickly
as possible.
Right now, think of five people who could benefit
from these amazing products.
Then, call or message them using the script
provided below before you continue reading.
This isn’t just about business—it’s about helping
others while building your success.
Step 3: SHARE the Opportunity
Your business grows when your team grows. The
key to real momentum? Sharing the OQATA
opportunity every single day.
Don’t just invite—ensure people actually see the
business presentation. Be intentional. Be
consistent. Make it your daily mission to share the
business plan with at least two people. The magic
happens when others see the vision for themselves.
At a bare minimum: Present two business plans
every day. No excuses, just action.
! Action Step:
Pick up your phone and call five people right
now.
Your goal? Set appointments for them to meet with
your upline mentor by tomorrow.
Use the scripts below to guide your conversations
and keep it simple, confident, and clear. This is
your next bold step toward building a powerful,
profitable team.
Step 4: EXPAND Your Name List
Every day is a new opportunity to connect—and
the next star in your team could be someone you
meet today.
Make it a daily commitment to add at least two
new names to your contact list. Your name list is
your business pipeline—it’s where your future
customers and business partners come from.
These could be:
• People you meet during your daily
activities
• New connections on social media
• Service providers you interact with
• Friends of friends or referrals
Wherever you are, keep your eyes open. Make a
habit of starting conversations, building rapport, and
adding names to your list for future follow-up—
whether for a product presentation or business
opportunity.
! Action Step:
Look back on your day so far—who did you meet
or interact with that you could add to your list?
Write down two new names right now, and
continue doing this every single day.
Remember: the bigger your list, the bigger your
business potential.
4
Step 5: LEARN & TEACH Daily
The best investment you’ll ever make is in yourself. In OQATA, we believe that learning isn’t optional—it’s
essential. This is a learning business, and the more you learn, the more you earn.
Commit to at least one hour of learning every day. What you learn, you teach your team. And when your
team grows, so do you.
Your growth fuels your business—so make it a priority.
Daily Training Resources at Your Fingertips:
✅ Daily Script & PowerPoint:
Every morning, we upload a training script and the
PowerPoint presentation to your IBO dashboard.
# Go to your dashboard → Resources → Start
learning
✅ Join Your Cell Team:
Your upline will introduce you to your cell team.
These small teams meet daily (online or in-person)
to review the scripts and learn from each other.
✅ Can’t Attend Live General Training? No
Problem!
The PowerPoint presentations uploaded daily are
the same ones used in our general training sessions.
Make it a priority to attend these live whenever you
can.
$ Missed it? No stress. The full video is uploaded
to your Showcase section—available anytime,
anywhere, during the day.
# Open your dashboard → Click “Showcase” →
Watch at your own pace

THE POWER OF YOUR DREAM: DESIGNING THE LIFE YOU
DESERVE
Welcome to Step 2 of Getting Started Right and Strong with OQATA Wellness Solutions!
In this step of your orientation program, we focus on a pivotal aspect of your success with
OQATA: The power of your dream.
This is not just about wishing for success. Wishing for success is often passive—it’s simply
hoping that things will turn out well without committing to the action required. Wishing
depends on external factors; when circumstances are perfect, those who wish for success are
excited, but when challenges arise, they give up. Their excitement is short-lived.
On the other hand, having a powerful dream is deeply personal and emotionally charged. A
powerful dream serves as a guiding force that fuels your motivation and persistence when
things don’t go as planned. And trust me, things won’t always be perfect. At OQATA, we
don’t promise you a bed of roses—we are a business, and just like any business, you will face
challenges. There will be many reasons to quit. As John C. Maxwell mentioned in his book,
Put Your Dream to the Test, your dream will be tested.
Your dream should be powerful enough to make you take action and commit to OQATA’S
DMO, no matter the challenges.
• Use the products
• Recommend the products
• Share the opportunity
• Expand your Name list
• Learn and Teach
While these steps look simple, you need a dream to remind you to do them daily. Otherwise,
you will backslide after the initial excitement fades.
Take time to reflect deeply:
! Why did I join OQATA?
! What do I want to achieve with OQATA?
! What is truly possible for me through OQATA?
Whatever your reason for joining OQATA, that dream will fuel your journey.

Rediscovering the Power to Dream
Dreams often get buried under the weight of daily responsibilities, doubts, and societal
limitations. Many people forget how to dream big. But at OQATA, we are giving you a
second chance to dream again—to dream bigger than ever before.
The beauty of the OQATA opportunity is that there are no limitations to what you can
achieve. The only limitations are in your mind and your actions.
" You can earn any amount of money you desire because this is a commission-based
business—the more you and your team sell, the more OQATA pays you.
" There are no territorial restrictions—you can expand your business as far and wide as
you wish: across districts, countries, and even continents.
" Your success is in your hands—you choose how much effort to put in.
Imagine this: If you go to the ocean to collect water, you have a choice—you can take a
spoon, a cup, a bucket, or even a massive tank. Or you can think outside the box and dig a
channel to bring in an endless supply.
The size of your dream matters.
• If you start with the attitude of earning just a little, that’s exactly what you’ll get.
• If you dream big and truly believe in your greatest potential, you will achieve far
more.
It’s no coincidence that the top earners in OQATA are making huge amounts of money and
living their dreams, while others are struggling. The difference? Mindset and the size of the
dream they choose to set.
Some people are being chased by a lion, while others are being chased by a chicken.

# What is chasing you?
Let’s embark on this journey by exploring your dreams in every area of life. Remember, there
are no limits—dream big and believe in the possibilities.
Below, you’ll find thought-provoking questions to help you reflect. Answer each one and list

You’ve explored your dreams across every area of life. Now, it's time to create a vision board
and craft a compelling story.
Dream Big! Act Now!
The Future You Want Begins Today!

1.Make a goal card
Well done for writing your goals! Now let’s take it a step further and turn those goals into a
powerful daily tool — your Goal Card.
This Goal Card is not just a piece of paper. It is your commitment to yourself. You will carry
it in your wallet, and you will read it twice a day:
• Morning when you wake up
• Night before you sleep
How to Make Your Goal Card:
1. Get a small card (wallet size).
2. Divide it into two sides:
• Front Side: Write your main goals in the present tense, as if they have already
happened.
• Back Side: Write your daily action plan — the consistent steps you will take to
achieve these goals.
Example of the Front of the Card (Main Goals):
MY GOALS
1. I am up and grateful that I am a Brass
Business Builder by December 2025.
2. I make sales of 500 CVs every month
with a customer base of 30 repeat
customers.
3. I have a team of 15 direct downlines
by December 2025.
4. I have a total team of 100 people by
December 2025.
5. I earn $200 per week in commission
alone and $100 in profits per week.
6. I read one book on MLM every
month and grow my leadership skills.
Example of the Back of the Card (Action Plan):
TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS, I DO THE FOLLOWING DAILY:
• I use the products daily and
recommend them to at least 2 new
people every day.
• I share my business opportunity with
at least 5 new people every day.
• I follow up with at least 5 prospects
or customers daily.
• I attend every team training and
Zoom call without fail.
• I read at least 10 pages of a good
book on MLM or personal
development daily.
• I keep my Dream Chart and my
WHY in front of me every day.
• I always keep a positive mindset,
speak life over my business, and
take action with belief.
Why This Works:
Your mind follows what you focus on. Reading your goals and action plan every day helps
you stay disciplined and consistent. It keeps your dream alive, sharpens your focus, and helps
you build the habits that create success.
Now, write your own Goal Card today. Cut it to wallet size. Carry it with you. Read it twice
daily. Watch your dreams begin to move toward you!

2.Create Your Vision Board or
Dream Chart
A vision board, also known as a dream
chart, is a powerful tool that brings your
dreams to life. This is where you take all the
goals and aspirations you have set and
transform them into visual representations
by downloading images from the internet or
cutting them out from magazines. Arrange
these pictures on a board that you can see
daily, share with your team, family, and
friends.
The more often you see and share your
dreams, the stronger they become in your
mind. Your subconscious begins to accept
them as reality, and your actions will align
with making them happen. A dream that is
shared does not disappear—it grows
stronger.
A vision board serves as a daily reminder of
your aspirations and keeps you focused on
your why. Fill it with:
✅ Images that represent your goals
(financial, lifestyle, business, health, etc.)
✅ Inspirational quotes that motivate you
✅ Symbols of success that remind you of
your journey
The best part? When you create your vision
board, your downlines will be inspired to
create theirs. A team with vision is a team
destined for success!
3. Design Your Story and Use It to
Inspire Others
Your story is one of the most powerful tools
for growing your business and building your
team.
Every person you introduce to OQATA
Wellness Solutions has one question in their
mind: "Why did you join, and why should I
join you?"
Your story must answer this question in a
way that is authentic, relatable, and
inspiring. If your story doesn’t inspire,
people won't feel compelled to join you.
Take a moment to observe top leaders in
OQATA. What makes them successful?
They are excellent at sharing their stories.
Think about it—what convinced you to join
OQATA? Most likely, it was someone’s
story that resonated with you.
Now, it’s your turn.
You might be thinking, "But I’m just new, I
don’t have a story yet."
I’ll tell you this straight: YES, YOU DO!
Your story is why you joined and why
someone else should join you.
Here’s a simple structure to guide you in
writing your story. Reflect deeply on each
question and write at least two to three
sentences for each. This will help you craft
a story that is powerful and impactful when
shared with prospects.
Who Are You?
Share a little about yourself—your name, background, where you come from, and your
profession.

3.
Building Your Namelist
Now that you have a clear vision of your dreams, it’s time to start working towards them.
Your namelist serves as the foundation for all the practical steps that follow. If you skip this
step, the rest of the GSRS program won’t make sense. This is the cornerstone of building a
strong and successful team.
What Is a Namelist?
A namelist is a collection of names of people who could be potential customers, potential
downlines, or anyone who can connect you to them. Essentially, it includes anyone who
might be valuable in promoting your products or opportunity. Think of it as your personal
treasure map for success in OQATA.
Why Is a Namelist So Important?
A namelist is crucial because it helps you
identify specific people to approach about
your opportunity and products. The number
one reason people fail in network marketing
is that they never create a namelist. Many
new members join, make a mental note of
just a few names, approach them, and when
those few people don’t join, they assume the
business doesn’t work.
You need to reach out to many people to
find the serious individuals who will help
grow your business. A namelist provides a
clear and structured way to do this.
Even when new people join, they often feel
like they don’t know anyone they can
approach. However, when you guide them
through the namelist exercise, they quickly
realize how many potential contacts they
actually have. This process not only
expands their perspective but also builds
their confidence.
A strong namelist should contain at least
200 names. Strive to reach this number if
you want to succeed. Don’t worry—we
shall learn how to achieve this easily using a
memory jogger.
How to Create a Namelist
To begin, purchase a notebook specifically for this purpose. Do not use your existing
notebook where you take notes or conduct presentations. This must be a brand-new book
dedicated solely to writing names—think of it as your personal bank. Make it special and
never use it for anything else. If you are serious about your success with OQATA, treat this
step with the importance it deserves.
Next, sit in a quiet place—preferably with your upline, to guide you. However, if they are not
available for one reason or another, you can do it alone. Remember that this is your business,
not theirs. It is your dreams that you want to achieve, not theirs. If you succeed, you will
21
enjoy the rewards; if you fail, it will be your loss. Treat this as your personal business,
starting with your namelist. However, if your upline is willing to support you, that’s great! It
means you have an upline who truly understands the business. Success in OQATA isn’t just
about recruiting people—it’s about helping the people you bring into the business succeed.
That’s why creating a proper namelist is so important.
Now, let’s begin! Write at least 20 names from each category in the memory jogger below.
The Memory Jogger
As the name suggests, the memory jogger is
designed to help you remember people you
can approach about your business and
products. Each person you write down will
trigger your memory to recall someone else.
Write down names even if they belong to
another category. Your goal is not to
organize people into perfect categories—it
is simply to generate at least 200 names.
For example, under the Family Members
category, you might start by writing your
parents' names. This could remind you of
your friends' parents—write them down too.
Then, you might remember their aunt, then
their aunt’s friends—write them all down.
Keep going!
When you can’t think of more names, move
to the next category or subcategory and start
brainstorming again. By going back and
forth, you can easily compile 200 names in
an hour or less.
Leave space between names. After each
name, leave two to three blank lines for
simple notes during follow-ups. Take notes
during calls. If you call someone and they
ask you to remind them in two weeks, use
the blank space to jot it down. Never
prejudge. This is not the time to decide who
will join or who won’t. Just keep writing
names until you reach 200 or more.
The Memory Jogger Categories
1. Family Members
Parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins,
in-laws, nieces, nephews, extended
family, etc.
2. People You See Regularly
Friends, neighbors, church members, co-
workers, social group members, etc.
3. Past Acquaintances
Childhood friends, classmates (from
elementary through college), former co-
workers, etc.
4. Professionals and Service Providers
Doctors, dentists, barbers, waiters,
grocery clerks, mechanics, teachers, real
estate agents, etc.
5. Hobbies and Activities
People you’ve connected with through
shared activities like golf, fishing,
running, or other hobbies.
6. Unique Situations or Life Stages
New parents, people seeking a second
income, those who recently moved, or
i n d i v i d u a l s l o o k i n g f o r n e w
opportunities.
7. Distant Contacts
People you know in other districts,
regions, or countries who may be
interested in your business or products.
8. Social Media Contacts
Facebook friends, Instagram followers,
LinkedIn connections, and other digital
networks.
These prompts will ensure you leave no one out. Right now, your only job is to write names.
This is not the time to categorize, judge, or invite them—just keep writing until you have at
least 200 names. The more names you write, the greater your chances of success!
22
Keep Expanding Your Namelist
Congratulations on reaching 200 names! If
you have more than 200, an even bigger
congratulations—you are truly serious about
your dreams.
However, if you have written fewer than
200 names, stop reading this now and go
back to complete your list. Do not move on
to the next step of this GSRS program until
you have hit 200 names.
If you don’t write 200 names, don’t blame
anyone else if you don’t succeed.
I hope you have reached your 200-name
goal. But even if you have, this is not the
end. A namelist is not static—it must keep
growing every day.
Every day, we meet new people, and you
should make it a habit to expand your
network by at least two new people daily.
As you go about your daily activities, keep
an eye out for strangers, turn them into
friends, and add them to your namelist.
Always be on the lookout—you never know
where you will find your next diamond.
This is part of your daily DMO.
Note: Building a namelist, like many parts of the GSRS program, is a practical activity best
done with guidance and in pairs. If you are fortunate to have completed this activity with
your upline, congratulations! If your upline didn’t assist, take this as a lesson—always ensure
your downlines are supported during this critical step.
For further insight, I recommend reading the Namelist chapter in The Master Key to Network
Marketing Success by CEO Elias Serugo Muhoozi. He provides practical advice on guiding
new distributors through this activity.
Start today, and let your namelist be the foundation of your success!
Congratulations on completing Step 3 of the OQATA New Distributor Orientation—The
Namelist! Your namelist is the heart of your business, filled with lives you can impact
through OQATA’s products and opportunities. By building and committing to expand your
list, you’ve laid a powerful foundation for lasting success. Keep reaching out, sharing, and
growing—your future starts here!
Declaration of Commitment
I, __________________________________, confirm that I’ve completed Step 3 and
understand that my namelist is the foundation of my success. I commit to continually
expanding and nurturing it as I grow my business with OQATA Wellness Solutions.
Signature: ___________________________
Upline Commitment
I, _______________________________, confirm that I have seen 200 names in the namelist,
and that my IBO ____________________________, has completed Step 3. I will guide and
support them in using their namelist to build strong connections and succeed with OQATA.

4.
Approaching Your Prospects
Now that you have completed your namelist, it's time for the next critical step: reaching out
to the people on your list. Since the people on your namelist came from your own
network, they are considered your warm market—people you already have a connection
with. This step will guide you on how to confidently approach them.
There are six types of meetings you can invite your prospects to:
1. One-on-one meeting – A personal
meeting between you and the prospect or
one where your sponsor joins you.
2. Business launch meeting – A home-
based gathering to introduce your
business.
3. Business Opportunity Presentation
( B O P ) m e e t i n g – A s t r u c t u r e d
presentation designed to showcase the
business.
4. Online meeting – Conducted via Zoom,
Google Meet, or other online platforms.
5. Video presentation meeting – A call or
conversation where you invite someone
to watch a video or send them a pre-
recorded video link that presents the
business or product.
6. Product demonstration appointment –
A meeting specifically to showcase and
explain the products.
In this step, we will discuss the different ways to invite people to these meetings. Then, in
Step 5 of this GSRS program, we will cover how to conduct these presentations effectively.

Setting Your Mind
Before we dive into how to approach people, let's first talk about the mindset needed for
success. Your mindset is the foundation of every successful approach. People buy into you
before they buy into your business or products. Confidence, sincerity, and enthusiasm will set
you apart.
1. Avoid a Prejudgmental Mindset
Make the decision to talk to everyone. Writing names on your namelist is one thing—actually
approaching them is another.
Many IBOs start to fear and prejudge when it’s time to reach out. Thoughts like:
• What will they think of me?
• What will they say?
• What if they’re not interested?
• What if they say no?
• They’re too rich.
• They’re too broke.
• They’re too old.
• They’re too young.
If these thoughts start to linger in your mind, it means you are prejudging.
Whenever in doubt, take action immediately—just dial the number and
say the words in the scripts provided. The moment you start speaking, your fear will
disappear.
24
Remember: A namelist is only as valuable as the action you take with it. The true magic
happens when you talk to everyone on that list.
2. Think Abundance
Many IBOs limit themselves with a scarcity mindset. It’s important to think with abundance
when approaching people.
• Have faith that people can afford the products. Who told you they can’t? Don’t say no
for them—let them say it for themselves. You’d be surprised how much people are
willing to buy.
• Remember, there are billions of people in the world interested in your business
opportunity and products. If one person says no, it’s not the end of the world—
someone else is waiting.
That’s why we asked you to list at least 200 names and continue adding at least two new
names per day.
3. Detach from the Outcome
Not everyone will say yes—and that’s perfectly fine. Your role is to share the information.
Let them decide if it’s right for them.
4. Focus on Helping, Not Selling
Approach every conversation with the intent to add value. When people sense your sincerity,
they’re more likely to listen to you.
OQATA is about improving people’s health and helping them become richer and happier. As
an IBO, your job is to find people to make healthier, happier, and wealthier—not just people
to make you happier and richer.
How to Approach Your Warm Market
Before reaching out, take a moment to
mentally segment your prospects into one of
the six categories listed earlier. You do not
need to rewrite your namelist into
categories. Instead, as you prepare to
approach each person, quickly decide which
category they belong to before you dial the
number.
Your script will vary based on the category
of the prospect. This segmentation allows
you to craft personalized and effective
messages, making your approach more
natural and engaging.
Below, we will discuss scripts you can use
for each category. These are guidelines to
give you ideas—feel free to adjust the
wording to match your own style and
comfort level.
Let’s get started!

❖ Keep it short and to the point.
❖ Use their name and make it personal.
❖ Suggest a specific day/time for the meeting. Don’t leave it up to them.
❖ If they ask, "What is it about?" respond with:
" "It’s something I can’t explain over text/phone. It’s better if I show you in
person. Let’s meet for 30 minutes—I promise it’ll be worth it!"
Category 2: Invitation Scripts for a Business Launch Meeting
What is a Business Launch Meeting?
A Business Launch Meeting is a small,
intimate gathering where a new IBO
introduces their closest friends, family, and
professional contacts to the business when
they’ve just started.
It’s a casual yet strategic way to kickstart
momentum, create excitement, and begin
building a team. The setting can be a home,
a local restaurant, or even a boardroom with
a few drinks and snacks—anywhere
comfortable enough to allow for a friendly
yet business-focused conversation.
The distributor may invite their sponsor or
an experienced leader to help with the
presentation.
Below are powerful scripts you can use to
invite your prospects to such a meeting.
1. The Direct Invitation
! "Hey [Name], I’ve just started an exciting new business, and I’m hosting a small
gathering at [venue] on [date/time] to share what it’s all about. Since you’ve always
supported me, I’d love for you to be there. It’ll be casual, just some good company, snacks,
and a short presentation. Can I count on you?"
2. The “Exclusive Invitation”
! "Hey [Name], I respect your opinion
and wanted to personally invite you to an
exclusive business preview I’m hosting at
[venue] on [date/time]. I’ve partnered
with a successful company, and I think
you’ll find this opportunity as exciting as
I do. It’s a casual, no-obligation event, but
I’d love your feedback! Can I reserve a
seat for you?"
27
3. The "Need Your Support" Approach
! "Hey [Name], I just launched my own
business and I’m super excited about it! I’m
hosting a small get-together at [venue] on
[date/time] to introduce it to my friends and
family. It would mean a lot to me if you
could come and support me. Plus, you might
even see something you’d love to be part of!
Can I count on you?"
4. The “Entrepreneurial Angle”
! "Hey [Name], I know you’ve got an
entrepreneurial mindset, and I thought of
you first! I’m launching a new business and
hosting an intimate event at [venue] on
[date/time] to share what I’m working on.
The potential here is massive, and I’d love
to get your thoughts. Can you make it?"
5. The "I Want You to Be First" Approach
! "Hey [Name], I’ve just started
something BIG, and you’re one of the first
people I wanted to tell! I’m having a private
gathering at [venue] on [date/time] to share
the details before it really takes off. I’d love
for you to be there—it’s an opportunity I
don’t want you to miss. Can I count you in?"
6. The “I Need Your Feedback” Approach
! "Hey [Name], I truly respect your
opinion, and I’m launching something really
exciting! I’m hosting a small business
preview at [venue] on [date/time] and
would love for you to check it out and give
me your honest feedback. No obligations,
just great info and a chance to network. Can
I reserve a spot for you?"
7. The “Success & Timing” Approach
! "Hey [Name], timing is everything, and
I’ve just stepped into a business opportunity
that’s blowing up! I’m inviting a small
group of people to my business launch at
[venue] on [date/time], and I really want
you to be there. This could be a game-
changer for you too. Are you open to
checking it out?"
8. The "Let’s Do This Together"
Approach
! "Hey [Name], I’ve found an incredible
business opportunity, and I immediately
thought of you. I know we’ve both talked
about [extra income, working for ourselves,
etc.], and this is our chance to make it
happen. I’m having a casual launch event at
[venue] on [date/time], and I really want
you to be there with me. What do you say?"
9. The “Casual & No Pressure” Approach
! "Hey [Name], I’m hosting a small
gathering at [venue] on [date/time] to
introduce my new business to a few friends.
It’s super casual—just some snacks, good
people, and a quick presentation. Come and
check it out! I think you’ll find it interesting.
Can you make it?"
10. The “FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)”
Approach
! "Hey [Name], I just partnered with an
amazing company, and the timing could not
be better! I’m having a private business
preview at [venue] on [date/time], and I
want to make sure you hear about this
before it takes off. You don’t want to miss
out! Can I save you a seat?"
Tips for Success:
❖ Follow Up! After sending the invite,
check in with them a day before the
event.
❖ Stay Confident & Excited! Your
enthusiasm is contagious—people
follow excitement.
❖ Use Voice Notes or Calls! Texting is
fine, but voice invites feel more
personal.
❖ Keep it Simple! Don't explain too much
—create curiosity and let the event do
the talking.
28
What if they ask what is all about?
Great question! If someone asks, "What is this all about?", your goal should be to spark
curiosity, not give too much detail. You want to excite them enough to attend without giving
them too much information. Here are a few powerful responses based on different approaches:
1. The Curiosity Hook
! "That’s exactly why I’m inviting you! It’s
a business model that I have just started. I’d
rather show you in person than try to explain
it over the phone. Trust me, the way I know you,
it’s worth checking out! Can I count you in?”
2. The Business-Minded Response
! "It’s a powerful business model that
allows you to build an extra stream of income
without quitting what you’re doing. I’m
hosting a small launch event to break it all
down, and as one of my close friends I’d love
for you to be one of the first to hear about it.
3. The Energy & Excitement Approach
! "It’s something that could be a game-
changer for both of us! I can’t explain it all
in a text, but if you trust me, just come to the
event and see for yourself. Worst case? You
enjoy some snacks and good company!"
4. The Social Proof Approach
! "Honestly, it’s something you have to
see to understand. If I try to explain it now, I
won’t do it justice! I’ve partnered with some
really successful. Instead of me trying to
explain, just come meet them and see what
this is about firsthand”
Important Tips When Answering Questions:
• Don’t explain too much! The more you explain, the easier it is for them to say "no"
before seeing the full picture.
• Stay excited! Enthusiasm is contagious—people follow energy.
• Always bring it back to the event. The goal is to get them there!
What if they ask, “is it network marketing?”
Great question! Your response should be honest but strategic. You don’t want to trigger their
misconceptions or prejudgments, but at the same time, you don’t want to be defensive.
One great way around this question is to highlight the uniqueness of OQATA and shift their
perspective.
Here are some powerful ways to handle this question gracefully while keeping the curiosity alive:
1. The "Hybrid Business Model"
Response
! "Yes, it’s network marketing, but it’s a
hybrid business model that’s never been
done before. It merges corporate strategies,
network marketing and e-commerce. This
is a model built for today’s economy. I
guarantee it’s unlike anything you’ve seen
before!
2. The "Business for the Modern World"
Response
! "Yes, it’s technically network marketing,
but it’s a business model built for today’s
economy. The company has revolutionized
how people earn by combining traditional
selling with seamless online e-commerce.
This is the kind of business people have
been waiting for! You’ll be blown away
when you see it!
29
3. The “New-Age MLM” Response
! "Yes, it’s MLM—but NOT the kind that
people run from! This company has
removed all the frustrating parts of the old
school network marketing and transformed
it into a modern business model. It’s an
opportunity you need to see for yourself!
You’ll love the way they designed it!”
4. The “Smart Income Model” Response
! "Yes, it uses network marketing
principles, but it’s not the same old thing.
It’s structured like a real business, not a
hustle. This company has integrated a
strong e-commerce platform that allows
you to earn both passively and actively. I
guarantee it’s nothing like the old MLMs.
You’ll love how they’ve designed it!"
5. The "Why Do You Ask?" Approach
! "That’s an interesting question—why do
you ask? Have you had experience with it
before?"
" Why it works: This puts them on the
spot to explain their thoughts instead of
making assumptions. If they had a bad
experience, you can clear up misconceptions.
6. The "I Thought the Same Before"
Response
! "I used to think network marketing was
one thing, but once I saw how this works, I
realized it’s completely different. Instead of
assuming, just come take a look. If it’s not
for you, no problem!"
Key Takeaways When Answering This Question:
❖ Acknowledge that it’s MLM, but
emphasize that it’s a NEW kind of
MLM that’s structured differently.
❖ H i g h l i g h t t h e i n n o v a t i o n s —
corporate integration, e-commerce,
structured success
❖ Avoid using too much jargon—keep
it clear, confident, and exciting.
❖ Shift the focus to the business
launch meeting where they can see it
for themselves
❖ Stay Confident – If you sound
unsure, they’ll think there’s
something wrong. Speak with belief!
❖ Don’t Get Defensive – If they sense
hesitation, they’ll assume it’s a
scam. Own it proudly!

personal invite works better than a

will you watch it?"

When do you think you’ll have time

Presenting the Business opportunity
Congratulations on reaching this crucial stage in your journey! By now, you’ve built your
namelist, started reaching out to prospects, and are ready to present your business
opportunity. This step aligns with Step 3 of OQATA’s Daily Method of Operation (DMO):
sharing the business opportunity with at least two people every day. Whether you choose to
do this online or in person, make it a non-negotiable habit—ensure that at least two
individuals see the business presentation daily. Over time, this consistency will lead to the
success you desire with OQATA.
The Importance of Mastering Presentation Skills
Presenting is one of the most fundamental skills in network marketing—perhaps the most
important. Every customer who buys from you and every team member who joins you does
so because of how effectively you presented the opportunity. There is no shortcut to
mastering this skill; it requires practice, commitment, and continuous improvement.
When you first start, you may rely on your sponsor or mentor to present on your behalf as
you observe and learn. However, it is crucial that you take ownership of this skill as quickly
as possible. The sooner you become confident in presenting the business opportunity
yourself, the faster you’ll be able to grow and lead your team successfully. Not only will this
empower you, but it will also enable you to teach others the same skill, creating a ripple
effect that strengthens your entire network.
Without the ability to present effectively, building a thriving network marketing business is
nearly impossible. So, commit to learning, practicing, and refining your presentation skills—
it’s the key to unlocking your full potential in this business.
The Six Types of Presentations in OQATA
As we discussed in Step 4, there are six different types of presentations you will use in
OQATA. Each serves a unique purpose, and mastering them will give you the flexibility to
reach prospects effectively, regardless of their preferences or circumstances.
1. One-on-One Presentation – A
personal meeting between you and
the prospect, where you introduce
the business directly. This can also
include your upline joining to
provide support.
2. Business Launch Meeting – A
small, intimate gathering where you
introduce the business to your closest
friends, family, and professional
contacts in a comfortable setting.
3. Business Opportunity Presentation
(BOP) – A structured, professional
presentation designed to clearly
showcase the business model,
potential earnings, and the benefits of
joining.
4. Online Presentation – Conducted
via platforms like Zoom, Google
Meet, or others, making it easy to
reach a wider audience remotely.
36
5. Video Presentation – A recorded
presentation that does the explaining
for you, allowing prospects to watch
at their convenience.
6. Product Presentation or
Nutritional Seminar – A session
specifically designed to highlight and
explain the products, their benefits,
and their unique selling points.
Making Presentations a Daily Habit
According to OQATA’s Daily Method of Operation (DMO), you must present the business
opportunity to at least two people per day. This does not include the people you simply prospect
or book appointments with—it refers to actual presentations where prospects engage with the
business opportunity through one of the six methods above.
To ensure you meet this goal, you need to schedule more than two appointments per day since
not everyone will show up or commit immediately. If you aim for massive success rather than
average results, increasing the number of daily presentations will be key. The bigger your
dream, the bigger your actions should be.
Commit to the Process
Success in network marketing comes down
to consistent action and discipline. The
more people you present to, the faster you
will see growth. Whether through one-on-one
m e e t i n g s , o n l i n e c a l l s , s t r u c t u r e d
presentations, or product showcases, each
interaction brings you closer to your goal.
Make it your daily non-negotiable habit to
share the OQATA opportunity and promote
your product. Stay committed, stay
consistent, and watch your business flourish!
___________________________________________________________________________
How to Present
Now that you understand the different types of presentations, let’s dive into how to conduct
each of them effectively.
First, let me warn you—presenting is like swimming. You can learn the techniques, but until
you actually jump in and practice, you won’t truly master it. The more you present, the better
you’ll become. The key to success is consistency and repetition.
1. One-on-One Presentation.
A one-on-one presentation is a personal
meeting between you and your prospect, in
which you introduce the business
opportunity or the products. Sometimes, your
upline may join the presentation to offer
support and credibility.
Learning how to conduct an effective one-
on-one is one of the most important skills
you need in network marketing. You must be
intentional about mastering this skill as
quickly as possible. In the beginning, your
upline will assist you by leading the presentations. Your job will be to invite your prospects,
fully edify your upline to them, and edify your prospects to your upline. Then, sit back and
observe as your upline presents.
Never be absent as your upline presents to your prospects—this is how you learn. Plus, your
prospect will feel more comfortable with you there, since they might not know your upline.
37
Two Types of One-on-One Presentations
There are two main ways to conduct a one-on-one presentation:
1. Using a Company Presentation Guide
and a Notebook ("Book of Circles")
This is one of the best methods because it
uses simple, accessible tools: a presentation
guide, a pen, and a notebook. The notebook
is often called the book of circles because
you'll draw a lot of circles during different
presentations to illustrate key points. This
approach is easy to replicate, which makes
it ideal for duplication.
2. Using a PowerPoint Presentation
You can also present using PowerPoint on
your phone or laptop. However, this is not
always ideal. If your prospect doesn’t own a
device like yours, they might feel the
business is too “technical” for them. Keep
things simple. Remember: your prospect is
silently asking themselves, “Can I do this
too?” The more relatable and simple your
tools, the more confident they’ll feel about
getting started.
Step 1: Preparation
1. Know Your Prospect
Before the meeting, learn as much as you
can about your prospect:
• What do they do for a living?
• Are they looking for extra income,
time freedom, or personal
development?
• Have they ever done MLM or
network marketing before?
If your upline will be doing the presentation,
share this information with them beforehand.
It helps tailor the presentation to what
matters most to your prospect.
2. Set the Right Environment
Choose a quiet, distraction-free location like
a coffee shop or company office. Avoid
meeting at the prospect’s home or
workplace, where distractions are more
likely.
Make sure:
• You’re dressed professionally.
• You have all necessary materials
(presentation guide, book of circles,
pen, product samples, testimonials).
• Your phone is on silent.
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 2: Build Rapport
People join people—not companies. Spend the first few minutes building a connection. Ask
questions that encourage your prospect to talk about themselves.
Be genuinely interested. Smile. Use their name. Show that you care about them, not just
signing them up.
Uncover Their “Why”
Your goal is to discover what they truly want. Ask;
• “What would you do with an extra $500 a month?”
• “What would your ideal lifestyle look like if money and time were no issue?”
This helps you understand their pain points and aspirations. Whatever they share becomes the
foundation of your presentation.
38
The power of edification
The simple definition of edification in networking is the art of transferring credibility to a
person. As a new member, you must learn how to properly edify both your upline and your
prospects when introducing them to each other. This process helps build trust and creates a
strong foundation for successful business presentation.
Never just bring your guest and dump them in front of your upline and tell them to present.
Network marketing is built on human connections. People don’t join a company; they join the
people they trust and respect. Since your prospect trusts you but may not yet trust your
upline, your job is to bridge that gap between them by establishing credibility for your upline.
At the same time, edifying your prospect to your upline makes them feel valued, which
increases their interest in the business.
Edifying Your Prospect
1. Introduce them by their full name and
mention how you know them.
2. Highlight their profession, interests, and
background (these are important to give
your upline hints on how to tailor the
presentation to your prospect).
3. Share their motivating factors—why this
business opportunity could benefit them.
4. Compliment their skills, work ethic, or
character to show why they are a great fit.
Edifying Your Upline
1. Mention their achievements and rank in
OQATA.
2. Highlight their success and experience in
the business.
3. Share how they have supported you and
why you admire working with them.
4. Make your prospect feel privileged to
meet them.
If Your Upline Is Presenting
Edify your prospect to your upline and your upline to your prospect. Be the bridge between
these two strangers. Then, let your upline take over while you observe and learn.
This is also the moment to share your personal story—how you got involved in the business
and what it has done for you.
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 3: Share the Business with Passion, Not Pressure
Now, transition into the business presentation. Use the following structure:
1. Company Profile
Introduce the company by sharing:
• When it was founded
• Its leadership
• Mission, vision, and values
• Legal status and certifications
This builds credibility and shows the
c o m p a n y ’s s t a b i l i t y — a n e s s e n t i a l
confidence-booster for your prospect.
2. Products
Explain the products clearly and briefly.
Address the following:
• What are the products?
• Who manufactures them?
• What makes them unique?
• What do they do?
• How have they helped you or others?
Share a testimonial or success story. Start by
mentioning the manufacturing partner,
39
Earth’s Creation Inc., to emphasize product
credibility and quality—even if your
prospect is primarily interested in the
business side. Discussing the products helps
demonstrate that this is not a scam.
___________________________________
3. Compensation Plan
Next, present the business model and
explain how people earn. Keep it simple and
factual—avoid exaggeration or going too
deep into technical details.
Your prospect is silently asking:
• Is there money here?
• Can I make money?
• Is this business doable for someone
like me?
Answer these questions clearly and
confidently. Also, highlight the training
and support system. Many people fail to
join because they fear failure—not because
they doubt the business or can’t afford it.
Assure them they won’t be alone.
___________________________________
4. Social Proof
Show that the business works by providing
evidence:
• Testimonial videos
• SMS/email payment alerts
• Bank statements
• Your dashboard
Let them see real results. This builds trust
and excitement.
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 4: Address Questions and Objections Gracefully
Invite questions. Respond with empathy, not defensiveness.
Use the Feel–Felt–Found method:
• “I understand how you feel. I felt the same way, but here’s what I found…”
This keeps the conversation relaxed and authentic.
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 5: Ask for the Decision (Call to Action)
Always close with a clear call to action.
Many prospects leave presentations without
joining simply because no one asked them
to.
Even if they don’t have the full amount to
sign up, they can:
• Make a deposit
• Fill out an application form
• Give you referrals
Also, always set a next appointment—to
attend a public presentation, meet your
upline, or complete registration. Give them
a reason to stay engaged.
Try asking:
• “Based on what you’ve seen, do you see
yourself doing this part-time or full-
time?”
• “Are you ready to get started and begin
building this together?”
If they say yes, enroll them immediately. If
they’re unsure:
• Offer a follow-up time
• Share a video or brochure
• Ask if you can stay in touch
40
Step 6: Follow Up and Follow Through
Regardless of the outcome:
• Thank them for their time.
• Send a voice note or message after 24 hours.
• Keep the relationship warm. Many people join after the third or fourth exposure.
If they join:
• Celebrate their decision
• Schedule a New Distributor Orientation
• Plug them into your training, support systems, and team culture
Bonus Tips for a Winning One-on-One
• Be relatable, not robotic. Speak from the heart.
• Practice. Role-play with your upline or accountability partner.
• Keep it under 45 minutes. Respect their time.
• Be energetic and smile. Enthusiasm is contagious.
• Use stories. Facts tell, but stories sell.
___________________________________________________________________________
2. Business Launch Meeting.
One of the most powerful ways to kickstart
your OQATA business is through a Business
Launch Meeting. Think of it as your official
grand opening—a personal way to say: “This
is what I’m building. Come see what it’s
about.” It is a small, intimate gathering at
which you introduce your new venture to
your closest friends, family, and professional
contacts in a relaxed setting. The goal is not
to pressure anyone into joining, but to invite,
inform and inspire them to explore what
you’re doing.
A Business Launch Meeting is a small event—often hosted at your home, a friend's, or a cozy
café—where you:
• Share your new business with the people you invited.
• Create excitement and curiosity.
• Leverage your upline to do the presentation while you observe and learn.
• Begin building your team or customer base from your warm market.
41
It typically includes:
• A short welcome by you
• A presentation by your upline or mentor
• Product samples
• Light refreshments (snacks, coffee/tea)
• Q&A and casual mingling afterward
Why a Business Launch Meeting Matters
• It gives you instant momentum
• It boosts your confidence
• It shows your seriousness and professionalism
• It allows you to learn while your upline
presents
• It gets your first sign-ups or product
orders
• It creates social proof among your
contacts
A step-by-Step Guide to Hosting Your Business Launch
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 1: Set the Date and Time
Choose a date within your first 7–10 days of
joining the business. Keep it simple and
short—ideally 60 to 90 minutes total.
Choose a time that works best for your
guests (e.g., evening after work or weekend
late afternoon).
Pro Tip: Give yourself enough time to
invite properly (3–5 days), but not so far out
that people forget.
Step 2: Choose the Venue
Pick a comfortable, welcoming location:
• Your home (living room or dining
area)
• A friend or family member’s house
• A small café with a private corner or
room
Make sure the space is clean, organized, and
has enough seating for everyone. Remove
distractions (TV, loud music, pets).
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 3: Invite the Right People
Create a list of 10–20 of
your warm contacts:
• Close friends
• Family members
• Neighbors
• Work colleagues
• Church or community
group members
Focus on people who:
• Support you
• Are open-minded
• Are looking for
opportunities
• Care about their health or
finances
Send personal invitations:
• Call them directly
• Send a voice note or
personalized message or
design invitation cards
• Avoid mass invites or
generic group messages
Here’s a sample script:
“Hey [Name], I just started a new business venture. I’m hosting a small business launch this
[day] at [time] with a few friends over coffee and snacks. I have also invited my mentor, who
is really successful in this business, to be the main presenter of the day. I’d love for you to
come and hear what I’m working on and support me!”
42
Step 4: Prepare the Space and Materials
Create a warm, professional atmosphere.
Essentials to prepare:
• Comfortable seating for all guests
• A display table for your products
• Business presentation tools (presentation guide, laptop, projector, flipchart)
• Light refreshments (coffee, tea, water, simple snacks like biscuits, fruit, or pastries)
• Music (soft background music as guests arrive)
If using a screen or laptop:
• Test everything in advance
• Make sure your upline has what they need to present
Step 5: Coordinate with Your Upline
Let your upline know:
• The number of guests expected
• Their backgrounds (e.g., professionals,
students, business-minded)
• The time they’ll be speaking
• How you want to introduce them
Tip: Arrange a short call or meeting with your upline to plan how the event will flow. Their
experience will make your launch much smoother.
___________________________________________________________________________
Step 6: The Event Flow
Here’s a simple structure to follow:
Arrival & Mingling (10–15 minutes)
• Greet each guest warmly
• Offer coffee/snacks
• Keep the atmosphere light and
relaxed
Welcome & Introduction (5 minutes)

you
Presentation (30–40 minutes)
• Your upline shares the company
story, products, and business
opportunity
• Keep it simple, clear, and engaging
• Let your guests try samples during
or after the presentation
Q&A and Testimonials (10–15 minutes)
• Let guests ask questions
• You or your upline can share
additional stories or examples

• Your upline invites guests to:
o Join the business

privately
43
Step 7: Follow Up After the Meeting
The fortune is in the follow-up!
• Within 24–48 hours, message or call your guests:
o Thank them for coming
o Ask what they liked best
o Offer to answer any remaining questions
o Invite them to take the next step (join, sample products, attend another event)
Even if they don’t join immediately, keep the connection warm. People often need 2–3
exposures before making a decision.
Extra Tips for a Great Business Launch
• Keep it short and sweet – 60–90
minutes is ideal.
• Stay authentic – Be yourself, not a
salesperson.
• Smile and relax – Let your upline do
the heavy lifting.
• Use simple language – Your guests
should leave thinking “I can do this too!”
• Don’t worry about who doesn’t show
up – Focus on those who do.
• Take photos (if appropriate) – Great for
memories and social media (with
permission).
3. Business Opportunity Presentation (BOP)
A Business Opportunity Presentation (BOP)
is one of the most powerful tools used in
network marketing to grow your team and
share your business opportunity with others.
It is a structured, professional event—usually
held in a company training center, hotel
conference room, or event hall—where
experienced leaders or uplines present the
business model, products, compensation
plan, and the benefits of joining.
As a new IBO, you are not expected to be the presenter. Your role is still important though:
you’re the bridge between your guests and the business. Your job is to invite guests, make
them feel welcome, sit with them, and guide them after the presentation.
This guide will help you understand exactly what to do before, during, and after a BOP, so
you can maximize your results and begin building your team with confidence.
1. Understanding Your Role at a BOP
Your primary responsibility as a new distributor is simple:
• Invite your prospects to the BOP.
• Welcome and sit with them at the event.
• Support and close them after the presentation.
You don’t need to explain the business yourself. Again, let the expert presenters do the heavy lifting.
44
2. How to Invite Your Guests
Inviting properly is the key to getting people to show up. Keep your invite simple, confident,
and curiosity-driven. Your goal is not to explain the business over the phone or message, but
to create interest and get them to the presentation.
✅ What to Say When Inviting:
Here are a few examples:
" “Hey [Name], I just partnered with a
company that’s doing something really
exciting in health and wealth. There’s a short
business presentation happening this [day] at
[location] at [time]. I’d love you to come
check it out with me—it’s just about an hour
and I think you’ll find it really interesting.”
" “A few of us are getting together for a
business event at [venue] this [day/time].
There’s a powerful speaker coming in, and
it’s something I’ve just started myself. I’m
inviting a few close people to see what I’m
working on. Can I count on you to be there?”
# Avoid saying things like:
• “Come join my MLM company/ team.”
• “I want to recruit you into my business.”
• “Come and buy something.”
Instead, lead with excitement, curiosity, and value.
3. Preparing for the BOP
Before the event:
• Confirm attendance with your guests on
the day of the BOP.
• Dress professionally. Remember, your
appearance reflects on the business.
• Arrive at the venue 15–30 minutes early.
• Coordinate with your upline or team so
they know you're bringing guests.
4. How to Receive and Host Your Guests
When your guest arrives:
1. Welcome them warmly. Greet them
with a smile, shake hands, hug if
appropriate.
2. Introduce them to someone from your
team or upline if they arrive early.
3. Escort them inside and help them find
a good seat—sit with them so they
feel comfortable.
4. Avoid leaving them alone or letting
them feel like an outsider.
✅ Your job is to:
• Keep them relaxed.
• Answer general questions.
• Let them know that someone else
will be doing the presentation.
• Assure them it will be short,
professional, and informative.
This builds trust and positions you as a serious and confident business partner.
45
5. During the Presentation
• Sit next to your guest, not away from them.
• Be attentive—nod, smile, clap, and engage
with the presentation.
• Don’t interrupt or whisper during the
presentation.
• Avoid checking your phone—lead by
example.
Your guest is observing you just as much as they’re listening to the presenter. If you’re
engaged, they’ll stay engaged.
6. After the Presentation: Closing and Follow-Up
As soon as the presentation ends: Turn to your guest and ask: “What did you like best about
what you saw?” This opens the door for a conversation, not confrontation.
Then answer all their question or objections, and call them to action.
Always ask for referrals:
Whether they are positive or not, ask for referrals. Referrals often lead to some of your best
recruits!
7. Follow Up Like a Pro
Within 24–48 hours:
• Send a thank-you message or voice note.
• Set another appointment with them to
come for a follow-up presentation or to
deposit or pay.
• Keep the relationship warm—most
people need 2–3 exposures before
making a decision.
If they join:
• Celebrate them!
• Plug them into your team’s onboarding and training.
• Attend the next BOP together—and let them bring a guest.
Final Thoughts
As a new IBO, you don’t have to be the expert—your job is to be the connector. Use BOPs as
your best tool to introduce people to the opportunity while letting experienced leaders do the
presenting.
Every guest you bring is a chance to learn, grow, and expand your business. The more guests
you bring, the faster you grow.
So show up with confidence, treat every guest like gold, and stay consistent. One guest could
change your business forever.

___________________________________________________________________________
5. Video Presentation
One of the simplest, most duplicable ways
to grow your MLM business is by using a
Video Presentation.
A video presentation is a pre-recorded
business overview that explains your
company, products, compensation plan, and
the opportunity—all without you having to
do much talking. It allows your prospect to
watch at their convenience, making it an
ideal tool for busy people and a powerful
asset for any serious distributor.
Why Use a Video Presentation?
• It's duplicable – Everyone on your team can use the same video, regardless of experience.
• It's consistent – The message is always clear and professional.
• It's convenient – Prospects can watch anytime, anywhere.
• It saves time – You don't need to repeat the same explanation 10 times a day.
• It builds credibility – Professionally done videos elevate the perception of your business.
49
How to Share a Video Presentation (The Right Way)
Sending someone a video might sound easy—but how you do it makes all the difference. The
goal is not to randomly spam by sending the link all over, but to create curiosity and guide
those to whom you sent it to actually watch it.
Step 1: Create Curiosity
Before you send the video, have a short, engaging conversation to spark interest. Ask;
“Are you open to looking at something that could help you earn extra income part-time?”
“If I sent you a short video that explains how I’m building a business online, would you take
a look?”
Once they say yes, you have permission to send the video.
Step 2: Set the Stage Before Sending
Let them know what to expect:
“Great! It’s a [10–20 minute] video that gives a clear overview of what we do—how we make
money, what the products are, and how the system works. Watch it with an open mind, and
I’ll check in with you after.” Then send the link.
Make sure the video is short, clear, and mobile-friendly. You can use a company-approved
video, a team-made version, or even record one yourself once you're confident enough.
Step 3: Set the Follow-Up Time (This is the secret sauce.)
Always schedule the next touchpoint before they watch the video. Say:
“When do you think you’ll be able to watch it—later tonight or tomorrow morning?”
“Awesome, I’ll follow up with you around [insert time] to hear what you think.”
If you don’t set a follow-up time, you’ll end up chasing them. If you do, you stay in control
of the process.
What to Do After They Watch the Video
1. Follow Up Promptly
Stick to the time you
promised. Reach out and say:
“Hey! Just checking in—
were you able to watch the
video?”
If they haven’t watched yet,
don’t pressure—just reschedule:
“No worries! When do you
think you’ll have a few
minutes to watch it? I’ll
check in after.”
2. Ask What They Liked Best
Once they’ve watched it, never
ask “What did you think?”
— it’s too open-ended.
Instead, say:
“What did you like best
about what you saw?”
This keeps the tone positive
and helps them focus on the
opportunity.
3. Ask the Key Question
D e p e n d i n g o n t h e i r
response, lead them into the
decision-making process:
“Can you see yourself
doing something like this
part-time?”
“Would you like to get
started now, or do you have
a few more questions
first?”
50
Closing and Call to Action
If they’re ready:
• Send them the registration link or
application form.
• Help them choose which package to
start with.
• Plug them into your onboarding
system (training, WhatsApp group,
etc.).
• Celebrate their decision!
If they’re interested but not ready:
• Invite them to a live presentation,
webinar, or one-on-one Zoom.
• Offer to connect them with your
upline or mentor.
• Send them an additional video or
success story to reinforce belief.
If they say no:
• Thank them politely • Ask for referrals:
“Totally fine! Do you know anyone who’s open to making extra income, maybe someone
looking for something flexible right now?”
Key Follow-Up Tips
• Track who you send videos to. Use a notebook or CRM app to follow up
consistently.
• Send reminder messages (gently) if they delay watching.
• Always leave the door open. Even if they’re not ready now, things change.
Make Sure Your Team Uses the Same Video
One of the best things about using a video is duplication. Make sure;
• Your team has access to the video link
• Everyone uses the same follow-up system
• You lead by example and share your results using this method
As your team grows, you’ll build a system that runs without you always explaining
everything yourself.

Handling Objections Like a Pro
Rejections Are Normal—Embrace Them!
A s you embark on your journey with OQATA Wellness Solutions, it is essential to prepare
yourself for one of the most common experiences in network marketing: OBJECTIONS.
Whether you’re just starting out or are a seasoned distributor, hearing “no” or
encountering concerns is a natural part of the process. But here’s the good news: objections
are not rejections—they are opportunities.
Think of objections as questions in disguise. They’re a sign that someone is interested enough
to engage in a conversation, even if they have doubts. Your role is not to convince or
pressurize, but to provide clarity, address concerns, and help them make an informed
decision. Remember, every successful distributor once stood where you are today—facing
doubts, navigating skepticism, and learning how to turn “no” into “not yet.”
This step is all about equipping you with the tools, mindset, and strategies to confidently
handle objections. When you master this skill, you’ll ultimately grow your business. Let’s
dive into some of the most common objections and how to address them effectively.
Common Objections and Effective Responses
1. "Is this a pyramid scheme?"
Why they ask: There’s a common misconception that network marketing is illegal or
unethical.
Primary Answer: “No, it’s not a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal and involve
no real products. In our business, we market real, high-quality products and earn
commissions based on actual sales. It’s a legitimate business model, just like franchising or
other direct selling business models, but without the high startup costs.”
Alternative Answers:
• "This is more like building a sales
team in any corporate setting, but
you get paid based on the team’s
collective performance."
• "If this were a pyramid scheme, it
wouldn’t last long in the market. The
company has been operating
successfully for years, complying
with regulations."
53
2. "I don’t have time."
Why they say it: People often feel they’re already too busy.
Primary Answer: “I completely understand! That’s actually why this opportunity is great—
it’s flexible and can be built around your existing schedule. You can start small, part-time as
long as you can spare, even with just 5-10 hours a week, and grow at your own pace.”
Alternative Answers:
• "Many of our successful
IBOs started with just a
few hours a week. It’s
about consistency, not
the amount of time."
• "The goal is to
eventually free up your
time by creating a
residual income stream,
so you’re not always
trading time for
money."
• "What if I showed you a
way to use your existing
time to create additional
income with this
business?"
3. "I’m not a salesperson."
Why they say it: Fear of selling or lack of confidence in sales skills.
Primary Answer: “You don’t need to be a salesperson. This is more about sharing something
you genuinely believe in and helping people. We provide all the support and training to make
it simple.”
Alternative Answers:
• "Think of it as
recommending a
favorite movie or
restaurant. If you can do
that, you can do this."
• "Our system is designed
to focus on building a
team and letting the
products sell
themselves."
• "Most of the people
who join us aren’t
salespeople, but they
succeed because of our
step-by-step training."
4. "I don’t have money to sign up."
Why they say it: Fear of financial risk or misunderstanding the investment.
Primary Answer: “I understand where you’re coming from. That’s exactly why I think this
opportunity could be great for you—it’s a low-cost way to start your own business, compared
to traditional businesses or franchises.”
Alternative Answers:
• "This is an investment in yourself and
your future. Many people find a way to
start small and grow from there."
• "If I showed you how to recover your
initial investment quickly, would you be
open to learning more?"
5. "Is this one of those things where only the people at the top make money?"
Why they say it: Skepticism about the fairness of the business model.
Primary Answer: “Not at all. In our business, your income is based on your own effort and
results, not your position. Some of the top earners joined long after the company started.”
Alternative Answers:
• "In OQATA, someone
who works harder and
smarter can earn more
than those above them."
• "Unlike traditional jobs,
there’s no cap on your
income here. It’s about
what you build."
• "The compensation plan
is designed to reward
everyone fairly,
regardless of when they
join."
54
6. "I’ve tried something like this before, and it didn’t work."
Why they say it: Negative past experiences with network marketing.
Primary Answer: “I understand. Many people have had similar experiences, often because
they didn’t have the right support or tools. Our team focuses on mentoring and helping you
succeed step by step.”
Alternative Answers:
• "Every company and system is different.
OQATA is a pan African company that
focus on training, support and giving you
the tools and mentorship to actually
succeed."
• "What specifically didn’t work for you
last time? Maybe I can show you how
we do things differently in OQATA."
7. "I need to think about it."
Why they say it: Hesitation or need for reassurance.
Primary Answer: “Of course! It’s a big decision, and I want you to feel confident. What
questions or concerns do you have that I can help address?”
Alternative Answers:
• "Take your time! In the
meantime, can I send
you some additional
information to review?"
• "Sometimes, the best
way to decide is to try.
Why not start small and
see if it’s a good fit?"
• "Thinking about it is
g r e a t , b u t w h a t
specifically are you
thinking about? Let’s talk
it through."
8. "Isn’t this market already saturated?"
Why they say it: Concern about competition and opportunity.
Primary Answer: “Not at all! Markets grow and evolve constantly. There will always be
people who are looking for an extra income or better health.”
Alternative Answers:
• "In OQATA, it's never about who
joined first, everyone has an
opportunity to make money."
• "OQATA is still new. There are a lot
of people who have never heard
about this business. There are a lot
of untapped markets."
9. "I don’t know anyone to talk to."
Why they say it: Fear of rejection or belief that their network is too small.
Primary Answer: “That’s okay! We’ll teach and train you how to grow your team and
connect with people who are already looking for an opportunity.”
Alternative Answers:
• "Most people start with
small, but the key is
learning through our
training how to grow
your network."
• "You might be surprised
how many people you
a l r e a d y k n o w w h o
would be interested
once you start talking
about it."
• " W e a l s o t e a c h
strategies for using
social media and other
tools to reach new
people."
55
10. "What if I fail?"
Why they say it: Fear of wasting time or resources.
Primary Answer: “Failure is part of any learning process, but with the training and support
we provide, you will succeed if you’re committed.”
Alternative Answers:
• "What if you succeed?
Wouldn’t it be worth
trying to find out?"
• "The only way to truly
fail is to never try. We’ll
be with you every step of
the way."
• "You’re never alone in
this—we succeed
together as a team."
11. "Your products are expensive."
Why they say it: People often compare your products to cheaper alternatives and may not
yet understand the value, quality, or benefits your products offer.
Primary Answer: “I understand it may seem that way at first glance, but our products are
designed to deliver superior quality and long-term value.”
Alternative Answers:
• "You’re absolutely right
—our products aren’t
the cheapest on the
market. They’re
premium because of the
quality ingredients and
processes used, and you
get what you pay for."
• " T h a t ’ s a c o m m o n
concern at first, but many
of our customers say they
can’t imagine going back
to cheaper products after
experiencing the results.
Let me share a quick
story about [specific
customer result]."
• " O u r p r o d u c t s a r e
different because they
[specific unique feature
or benefit]. Once you
understand how they
work, the price makes
more sense."
12. "Show me what you’ve benefited."
Why they say it: Prospects want proof that the opportunity or products have tangible results,
and they may be skeptical about your personal success or experience.
Primary Answer: “I completely understand why you’d want to see results before jumping in.
While I’m still building my own success story, I can share stories of others who started where
I am and have achieved amazing results. This is a business that grows over time, and what’s
exciting is that I’m on the same journey, just like you can be.”
Alternative Answers:
• " T h a t ’ s a g r e a t
question! While I’m in
the early stages, I’ve
been fortunate to work
w i t h m e n t o r s a n d
teammates who have
achieved incredible
results. Let me share a
q u i c k e x a m p l e o f
[ s p e c i f i c p e r s o n ’s
success story]."
• "I’ve already seen great
r e s u l t s w i t h t h e
products myself. For
i n s t a n c e , [ d e s c r i b e
p e r s o n a l p r o d u c t
benefit]. And many
others have had similar
o r e v e n b e t t e r
experiences."
• "I’ve just started, but I
have a clear plan and
the guidance of people
w h o ’ v e d o n e t h i s
before. Here’s where I
see myself in the next
few months, and I’d
love for you to be part
of it too."

Final Thoughts
Objections are a natural part of the network marketing process and an opportunity to understand
the feelings of your prospect. They’re a chance to clarify, and overcome doubts. Shift your
perspective and see objections as stepping stones rather than roadblocks.
To ensure you’re always prepared, here are some final tips for handling objections effectively:
1. Listen First
Objections often stem from a deeper concern or misunderstanding. Before jumping to respond,
take a moment to truly listen. By understanding the root of the objection, you can tailor your
response to address their specific needs.
2. Empathize and Relate
People are more likely to trust you if they feel you understand them. Share a similar concern
you had or relate their feelings to those of others who have successfully overcome similar
doubts.
Key Tip: Use the Feel, Felt, Found principle. Say something like, “I completely understand. I
felt the same way when I started, but here’s what helped me see things differently.”
3. Stay Positive and Confident
Avoid being defensive or dismissive. Approach objections with a calm, positive attitude and
frame your responses in a way that highlights the potential of the opportunity. Confidence in
your response builds credibility and trust.
4. Use Third-Party Resources
Sometimes, hearing from others can make all the difference. Share testimonials, invite them to
webinars, or introduce them to someone who can share their success story. Third-party
validation often carries more weight than your personal assurances.
Key Tip: Offer to connect them with a mentor or teammate who can address their concerns
from another perspective.
5. Focus on Building Relationships
The goal isn’t just to overcome objections—it’s to build trust and long-term relationships. Even
if someone doesn’t join your team or buy your products right away, maintaining a positive and
respectful connection keeps the door open for future opportunities.
Key Tip: Always leave the conversation on a positive note, such as, “I appreciate you taking the
time to chat with me. If you have any more questions, I’m always here to help.”
Well done! Completing Step 6 means you're now equipped to handle objections with confidence
and professionalism.

The Power of Training
W elcome to one of the most important chapters of this booklet—and perhaps one of the
most important truths you will ever learn in your journey with OQATA wellness
solutions.
If you want to succeed in OQATA, training is not optional. It is the difference between
success and failure. It is the bridge that connects you from where you are now—brand new
and maybe unsure—to where you want to be: confident, knowledgeable, consistent, and
earning.
We All Start at the Same Level
Whether you are a university graduate, a high school leaver, a banker, a housewife, or a boda-
boda rider, when you sign up as an IBO in OQATA, we all start at a leveled playing field.
No one is born knowing how to prospect, invite, present, close, follow-up, or build a strong
team. These are skills, and like any skill—driving, cooking, swimming—they must be
learned, practiced, and improved.
That is where training becomes your lifeline.
The Big Truth: Training Makes the Difference
Let us be brutally honest: there are no shortcuts in OQATA. Anyone promising you an easy
path is not being real. If you are not willing to create time for training, then it’s better not to
waste your time joining OQATA at all.
This business is not for the lazy. It’s not for the wishful thinker. It is for the intentional
learner.
No one can fail in OQATA if they commit to training. And no one can succeed if they don’t.
Training is the guarantee that you will grow. Those who attend training consistently grow
faster, earn faster, and rise faster.
How OQATA Has Invested in Your Success Through Training
At OQATA, we believe training is the engine of growth, and we’ve put powerful structures in
place to support you every single day. The company has invested heavily in structured,
practical, and easy-to-access training programs to make sure you never walk alone.
“Those who attend training consistently grow faster, earn faster, and rise
faster.”

Here’s a breakdown of the types of training available for you:
1. Cell Training –
Every day begins with CELL training 8:00am — a powerful 60-minute team-based session
designed to build connection, accountability, and skill.
• Each cell is a small group of 5 to 10 members, led by an upline or a senior distributor.
• A downloadable script is provided every morning via the resources section on the
Dashboard to guide the discussion.
• A moderator is selected daily to lead the session.
! Tools of Trade Check
The session starts with a quick call to confirm that each member has their essential Tools of
Trade, including:
• A Name List
• A Circles Book
• A Presentation Guide
• A Goal Card
• A Notebook
• The GSRS booklet
These are non-negotiables for anyone serious about growing in the business.
" Discussion Flow
• The moderator selects a member to read one Point from the script.
• They explain the point, and the rest of the cell reacts and discusses it.
• Then another person is chosen to read another Point, and the discussion continues.
• This round-table style keeps everyone engaged and ensures every point is fully
discussed.
When a cell grows beyond 15 members, it is encouraged to split and form a new cell, led by
the next rising leader.
2. The Power hour
The Power Hour is one of the most important
parts of the day in the OQATA system. It
takes place at 9:00 AM, immediately after
the CELL training session. This hour is
designed to be an intense, focused period of
action where every distributor, whether brand
new or highly experienced, picks up their
phone and gets to work. Armed with their
name lists, referral forms, or contact leads,
they begin making calls with one primary
goal in mind: to book appointments and
invite prospects for a business presentation, a
product demo, or a one-on-one meeting,
either for the same day or the following day.
This culture is a cornerstone of success in the
OQATA system. The Power Hour creates a
unique synergy because everyone is doing
the same activity at the same time. You’re
surrounded—physically or virtually—by
teammates who are also calling their
prospects, sharing wins, learning in real-time,
and supporting each other. It builds
momentum for the day, and keeps everyone
aligned and accountable.
In network marketing, the real business
begins with making appointments. Without
appointments, there are no presentations, no
sign-ups, and no sales. Booking meetings
with potential clients and business partners is
the foundation of everything. It is the
essential daily activity that moves your
business forward. That’s why the Power
Hour is not optional—it is non-negotiable. If
you miss it, you’ve missed a major part of
what makes network marketing with OQATA
work.
This focused time of group activity also
accelerates learning. New distributors gain
confidence as they observe and imitate more
experienced ones. People naturally improve
their invitation skills, phone posture, and
communication strategies by simply being
part of the process. Over time, this consistent
habit shapes professionals out of beginners
and leaders out of followers.
If you want to build a serious business with
OQATA, the Power Hour is where it all
begins.

3. General Training
After cell sessions, all IBOs gather for the General Training at 10:00 AM — a structured
session for the entire team.
• Training slides are available in the dashboard resources.
• The MC calls the room to order, starts with a prayer, and recognizes all cell groups
present with their chants.
• Then, everyone joins in the Company Self-Talk.
# OQATA COMPANY SELF-TALK
MC: WHO ARE WE?
Audience: WE ARE OQATA UGANDA!

4. Online Trainings and Presentations – Learn from Anywhere
Time: Usually after 8:00 PM (varies by schedule)
Where: Zoom (or other live online meeting platform as communicated)
What to Expect: Weekly topics ranging from product knowledge to advanced skills

Final Word: Commit to Train or Commit to Quit
Let’s end with one undeniable truth:
Training is the one thing that guarantees your success.
You can have the best products, the best team, the best company—but if you don’t train, you
will struggle. If you take your training seriously, nothing can stop you.
So ask yourself:
• Am I showing up daily for cell training?
• Am I attending general training consistently?
• Am I watching the recordings?
• Am I reading the books?
• Am I taking notes and applying what I learn?
If the answer is yes, then success is not a matter of if—it’s only a matter of when.
Now go ahead and train like your future depends on it—because it does.
You’ve got the tools. You’ve got the team. You’ve got the training.

How to Conduct Product Presentation or Nutritional Seminar
Since we have learned about the products, we shall now learn how to do a nutritional seminar.
Not all presentations should be about people joining; a nutritional seminar is a great way to
promote products while teaching people about proper nutrition. Whether you're hosting a one-on-
one session, a community health talk, or a virtual nutritional seminar, your goal is simple: create
a need, educate on proper nutrition, and empower them on how take control of their health —
while confidently introducing them to OQATA's high-impact nutritional supplements.
This practical guide walks you through every phase of a powerful, results-driven presentation.
______________________________________________________________________________
1. Start with the “Why”: Show the Need
“People will only seek a solution when they understand the seriousness of the problem.”
You could Begin by explaining the global health crisis rooted in poor nutrition:
• According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 11 million deaths each year
are linked to poor diet.
• Globally, 1 in 3 people is either undernourished or overweight, and 88% of all countries
face serious malnutrition challenges.
• The rise of lifestyle diseases (diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancers, autoimmune
conditions) is directly connected to what we eat—or don't eat.
Highlight the shocking truth:
Most people think they’re eating well, but they’re not.
78
2. Educate on Proper Nutrition: What It Really Looks Like
Use the Healthy Eating Pyramid (Harvard School of Public Health model):
• Base of the pyramid: Daily physical
activity + weight control
• Second layer: Whole grains, healthy oils
(e.g., olive oil), fruits, and vegetables
• Middle layers: Nuts, legumes, fish,
poultry
• Top of the pyramid (limited intake): Red
meat, refined grains, sugar, and processed
foods
Problem? Most people eat from the TOP of the pyramid every day—and rarely get the nutrients
from the base.
______________________________________________________________________________
3. Show the Dangers of Our Modern Diet
We’re eating more calories—but less nutrition.
"We are overfed, but undernourished."
• Processed food lacks micronutrients
• Soil depletion reduces the nutritional
value of fruits and vegetables
• Overcooking destroys vitamins
• Busy lifestyles = poor meal planning
______________________________________________________________________________
4. Present the Solution: Eat Better + Supplement Smarter
Teach them this truth:
Even with a good diet, you cannot get everything your body needs from food alone.
That’s where quality supplementation comes in.
✅ Supplements don’t replace food—but they fill nutritional gaps.
✅ They protect the body, prevent disease, and boost performance.
✅ They work best when they are scientifically formulated, bioavailable, and made with clean
ingredients—like OQATA’s food supplements.
______________________________________________________________________________
5. Introduce the OQATA Supplement Line
Now that your audience understands the need and the solution, introduce OQATA’s premium
supplements as the trusted option.
Structure your product breakdown:
For each product:
1. Problem it solves (e.g., low immunity,
fatigue, poor digestion)
2. Key ingredients
3. Unique selling points (e.g., patented
ingredients, high potency, FDA-registered
facility, NSF-certified, etc.)
4. How to use
5. Testimonies if available
79
Examples:
• Colon Detox – Supports digestion, relieves constipation, cleanses the gut
• Super Focus Gummies – Enhances memory, focus, great for children & adults
• Resveratrol – Natural longevity booster, heart & brain health
• Liver Care with CurQLife – Detoxifies liver, supports skin health

Reassure them of OQATA’s uncompromising quality:
• Manufactured in USA-based, FDA-registered, GMP-compliant facilities
• Certified for purity, potency, and safety
• Backed by science and transparency
______________________________________________________________________________
6. Keep It Interactive
• Ask questions: “Have you ever felt
tired even after a full night’s rest?”
• U s e v i s u a l s : C h a r t s , p r o d u c t
packaging, ingredient benefits
• Allow short testimonials: Invite real
u s e r s t o s h a r e 3 0 – 6 0 s e c o n d
experiences
• Include a live Q&A session at the end
7. Close with a Clear Call-to-Action
Give your audience simple, confident next steps:
• “Start with a 30-day supply and feel the difference.”
• “If you're unsure, let’s do a quick wellness assessment.”
• “We have a loyalty discount for those ready to commit to their health.”
BONUS: Offer a product bundle or starter pack for first-time users.
Final Tips for Presenters:
• Be passionate, not salesy—you’re
educating, not pitching
• Use personal stories and transformation
experiences
• Keep your tone conversational, not
technical
• Stick to real problems and real
solutions
• Know your products inside and out
• Always tie back to the bigger mission:

The Business Kits
We offer four business kits to suit different
budgets and business goals for those who
intend to become IBOs. While the prices of

globally.

to customers.
Flexibility in Pricing:
• You can sell at a price higher or lower than the SRP.

o BV Difference Needed: 600 BV
(Superior) - 100 BV (Starter) = 500
BV.

7. Generational Leadership Bonus
The Generational Leadership Bonus recognizes exceptional leaders who have reached the rank of
Emerald Global Leader or higher. This bonus pays on the CV generated across your generations
of Platinum Leaders and beyond.
What You Earn
The bonus pays a percentage of CV from up to four generations, depending on your rank:
Understanding Generations
• Generation 1 includes the first IBO in your downline who is Platinum Leader or higher, along with
their entire sponsorship tree until the next qualifying leader.
• Subsequent generations begin with the next Platinum Leader or higher and their sponsorship tree,
and so on.
• If an IBO qualifies at Platinum but is not ranked Platinum or higher for the current period, they
contribute to your Team Qualification Volume (TQV) instead of being considered a new generation.
8. Car & Lifestyle Trip Award
Achieving success with OQATA Wellness Solutions means more than just earning bonuses—it’s

celebration of your hard work and dedication.

5. Holding Tank
The Holding Tank is a powerful tool that gives you greater control over your binary genealogy,
enabling you to strategically manage your team placements and maximize your weekly earnings.
How It Works:
• Temporary Placement: When you enroll a new IBO into your team, they are first placed
into your Holding Tank instead of being directly positioned in your binary genealogy.
• Strategic Positioning: You can decide the exact position where you want to place this
new IBO in your binary structure. This flexibility allows you to:
o Balance your weak and strong legs effectively.
o Control how many points are paired each week.
o Avoid exceeding your weekly pairing cap unnecessarily.
Earnings and Binary Points:
• Binary Points (BP) and Binary
Volume (BV) for a new IBO are only
credited to your genealogy once you
place them in your binary tree.
• Any bonuses or commissions linked
to BV and BP are activated only after
placement from the Holding Tank.
Grace Period:
• The system gives you a 3-day grace
period to place your new IBO into
your binary structure.
• I f t h e 3 d a y s e l a p s e w i t h o u t
p l a c e m e n t , t h e s y s t e m w i l l
automatically place the IBO, and this
action cannot be reversed.
